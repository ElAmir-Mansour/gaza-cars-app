══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY FLUTTER TEST FRAMEWORK ╞════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The following StateError was thrown running a test:
Bad state: A test tried to use `any` or `captureAny` on a parameter of type `CarEvent`, but
registerFallbackValue was not previously called to register a fallback value for `CarEvent`.

To fix, do:

```
void main() {
  setUpAll(() {
    registerFallbackValue(/* create a dummy instance of `CarEvent` */);
  });
}
```

This instance of `CarEvent` will only be passed around, but never be interacted with.
Therefore, if `CarEvent` is a function, it does not have to return a valid object and
could throw unconditionally.
If you cannot easily create an instance of `CarEvent`, consider defining a `Fake`:

```
class MyTypeFake extends Fake implements MyType {}

void main() {
  setUpAll(() {
    registerFallbackValue(MyTypeFake());
  });
}
```

Fallbacks are required because mocktail has to know of a valid `CarEvent` to prevent
TypeErrors from being thrown in Dart's sound null safe mode, while still
providing a convenient syntax.
